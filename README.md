My name is Ferdinand and I am living in Carinthia, which is the southernmost state in Austria.

My Motto: Don't overengineer for the future. (Learnt through hard lessons)🌱


This repository contains my personal projects that I want to share, lots of gamejams, which were all held by the [ITEC University of Klagenfurt](https://www.itec.aau.at/gamejam/), and also my personal blog and website, as they are public anyway.

From a tech perspective, I am interested in building AI applications ✨, data processing pipelines and retrieval systems 🤖, which is unfortunately closed work, but I will try to implement some open source versions as well! I am also interested in all kinds of home automation with Home Assistant, but unfortunately I am missing the time for that lately.

My tech stack, not programming languages, usually consists of any one or a combination of:
- [React](https://react.dev/), especially [NextJs]([https://nextjs.org/) using typescript only
- [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), also typed
- [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

I am a big fan of self hosting and open source software, not getting vendor-locked by any big company. My database of choice is [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) which hase some awesome (partial open source) capabilities that are most of the time all you need!
- Timeseries database: [timescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/)
- Vector Database: [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)
- Geo Spatial Data: [PostGis](https://postgis.net/)
- Automated REST-Endpoint: [PostgREST](https://docs.postgrest.org/en/v12/)

Most of this functionality is thanks to PostgreSQL's awesome [extension functionality](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/external-extensions.html)

I host everything on either [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) or on bare metal in my basement 💪.

Besides sitting in front of a screen all day, I am a volunteer firefighter 👨‍🚒, owner of a stubborn mixed Shiba-Inu 🐕, that coincidentially looks very much as the emoji, that takes me outdoors on adventures. Yes, that phrasing is correct. She dictates where we are goinng if I don't pay attention.

If you want current news about what I am up to, head to my [blog](https://theelk205.github.io/personal-website/) or [website](https://ferdinand-koeppen.tech) as you won't find me present on any social media. You will maybe find accounts, but I rarely or never use them.
